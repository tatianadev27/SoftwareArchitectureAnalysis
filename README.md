# Software Architecture

## Overview

Welcome to the Software Architecture repository! This project is aimed at demonstrating various architectural principles, design patterns, and fundamental software architecture concepts. The architecture principles and patterns showcased here are inspired by the book "Fundamentals of Software Architecture" by Mark Richards and Neal Ford, as well as the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a hands-on exploration of software architecture concepts. By implementing various patterns and principles, we strive to create a clear, modular, and maintainable codebase. Developers can use this repository as a reference to understand, apply, and experiment with these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Architectural Principles

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each module or class in this project adheres to the SRP, focusing on a single responsibility. This ensures clarity and maintainability by isolating reasons for change.

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP is embraced through extensible designs that allow the addition of new features without modifying existing code. This is achieved by providing well-defined extension points.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP ensures that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In this project, polymorphism is applied to adhere to the LSP.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP is followed by breaking interfaces into specific, client-focused ones. This prevents clients from being forced to implement unnecessary methods. 

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

DIP is applied by relying on abstractions, reducing coupling and promoting flexibility. High-level modules depend on abstractions, and low-level modules provide concrete implementations.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

#### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is prominently used in scenarios where the creation of objects follows a common interface, but the specific implementation is deferred to subclasses. The `NotificationFactory` is an example of this pattern.

#### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is employed to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

#### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is used in specific modules where a single instance is crucial.

### Structural Patterns

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is employed for robust event handling, facilitating communication between components. It ensures that changes in one part of the system trigger appropriate actions in dependent components.

#### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is used to allow the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. This is particularly useful for integrating legacy code.

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

#### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.

## Fundamental Software Architecture Concepts

### Microservices

The project adopts a microservices architecture, decomposing the system into small, independent services. These services communicate through well-defined APIs, providing scalability and maintainability benefits.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD concepts are applied to identify and model key business domains. This results in an aligned and cohesive architecture that accurately reflects business requirements.

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

Event-Driven Architecture is used to build loosely coupled systems where components communicate through events. This enhances scalability and responsiveness.

## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture principles are incorporated to separate concerns into distinct layers: entities, use cases, and interfaces. This promotes maintainability, testability, and adaptability to changes.
